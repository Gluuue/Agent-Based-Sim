The Boids algorithm implemented in Unreal Engine 5 using C++ scripts.

The code here implements the three main rules of the boids algorithm, and also contains extra code that limits the boid's speed to a chosen value, and also provides an exterior boundary that the boids will be encouraged to avoid leaving.
